# Task 2 Bonus (Broken Tests to show failed)

Note on the bonus question: I made a new bonus branch on which I broke
testcases intentionally, in order to demonstrate the error output.

Notes:

The first step is to update "build.properties" with your local
settings.  You do not need to set z3 and latte, but in that case
some unit tests won't run.
